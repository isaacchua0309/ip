# Boblet and AI Integration  

Boblet leverages AI tools to enhance and streamline the development process. These tools played a key role in boosting productivity, troubleshooting issues, and improving the overall quality of the project. This document provides a transparent overview of how AI contributed to the development of this application.  

## AI Utilization  

### 1. Enhancing Productivity and Debugging  
AI tools, including ChatGPT, were employed to:  
- Refactor the codebase by applying object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, modularizing the system into components such as `Ui`, `Storage`, `Parser`, and `TaskList`.  
- Identify and resolve issues like type mismatches and parsing errors, ensuring smooth functionality and efficient bug fixes.  
- Recommend reusable design patterns for implementing commands such as `agenda` and `help`, minimizing redundancy.  
- Assist in generating test cases to validate core application functionalities, improving reliability and robustness.  

### 2. Code Refinements  
AI provided valuable insights for generating and reviewing alternative method implementations, enhancing the structure and readability of the code. Examples include:  
- Designing parsing logic to accommodate multiple date formats using AI-suggested approaches.  
- Optimizing error-handling mechanisms to improve user feedback and gracefully manage edge cases.  
- Ensuring compliance with Java coding standards and best practices.  

### 3. Documentation Support  
AI-assisted in drafting initial documentation, including:  
- The `README.md` file, which contains installation steps, usage guidelines, and command examples.  
- This `AI.md` file, which transparently details AI’s role in the development process.  

### 4. Verification and Originality  
All AI-generated content was carefully reviewed and adapted to meet the project’s requirements. Non-trivial code snippets were modified and validated for correctness. AI-generated suggestions were treated as learning aids, ensuring the final implementation reflects a deep understanding of the underlying concepts.
