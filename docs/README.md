## **Design Overview**

### **Architecture**
Boblet's architecture follows an object-oriented design:

1. **Task Class**:
   - Base class for tasks (ToDos, Deadlines, Events).
   - Supports **description, status (done/not done), and task type**.

2. **Task Types**:
   - `Todo` â†’ Simple task.
   - `Deadline` â†’ Task with a deadline.
   - `Event` â†’ Task with a specific time.

3. **Exception Handling**:
   - Custom `BobletException` for user input validation.

---

## **Future Enhancements**

1. **File Persistence**:
   - Save tasks to a file and load them on startup.

2. **Date & Time Parsing**:
   - Use Javaâ€™s `LocalDate` for better deadline and event tracking.

3. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - Transition from CLI to a **JavaFX-based GUI**.

4. **Task Prioritization**:
   - Introduce task priority levels (High, Medium, Low).
